# 🛒 B2B Mediation Platform – Store Mobile App (Flutter)

A production-ready **B2B mobile application** for supermarkets to manage supplier offers, build their own catalog, handle purchases, and perform sales operations — powered by a **Laravel 12 API (JWT Authentication)**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This app is part of a **B2B Mediation System** that connects:

* 🏭 Suppliers (data-only, managed by admin)
* 🏪 Stores (mobile app users)
* 🧑‍💼 Admin (web dashboard)

> The Store app is the main consumer of the system, handling real business workflows:
> **Browse → Select → Purchase → Sell → Track → Analyze**
